## Solving resource constraints in Kubernetes

### Background of the issue

Dev Teams are deploying to Kubernetes clusters with resources defined with requests and
limits with number of replicas.

But most of the time teams overprovisions the resources in their deployments/sts

As a SRE/K8S engineer you must expand the on-premises clusters to meet the demand. If
itâ€™s a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud, then something like Azure Cluster Autoscaler will
occur.

Both scenarios are highly inefficient and less cost effective.
